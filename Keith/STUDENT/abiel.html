                Hello, I'm John Abiel Emejas Villeza, currently residing in Sta. Mesa, Manila. I have a deep passion for cars, which reflects in my hobbies of collecting diecast cars and capturing the beauty of automobiles through photography. Being an avid Formula 1 fan, I find joy in watching the races and staying updated with the latest in the automotive world. In the realm of sports, I once pursued basketball and taekwondo until high school, showcasing my commitment to physical activity and discipline. My love for exploration and adventure stems from my scouting days, which allowed me to traverse various places across the Philippines. Looking ahead, my goals involve owning a car, venturing into business, and aspiring to become a pilot. These aspirations drive my determination to embrace new challenges and carve a unique path forward.
