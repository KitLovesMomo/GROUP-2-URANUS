                My name is Jeric Dale S. Medida I'm 18 yrs old.I love to travel with my friends and one of my favorite places to go is nature to refresh myself in the chaotic environment.I like to play basketball and ride motorcycles. I'm not a materialistic person but if I could receive something from someone else it would be a bracelet.I also like to listen to music, especially Taylor Swift's songs, so I fell in love with Taylor's song because my friend suggested it to me and I liked it. I am also a mama's boy and grandmother's boy. And my dream is to be the first engineer in our family because this is one of my promises to my mother that when I graduate I will fulfill my promises and I will payback to all what he did.
