            <p class="info"> As students, it is important for us to understand legal, ethical, and social issues in media information. Firstly, we need to learn about the laws and regulations that govern media, such as copyright and intellectual property rights. This knowledge helps us ensure that we respect and protect the work of others. Secondly, we should be aware of ethical considerations, such as truthfulness, objectivity, and avoiding conflicts of interest. This helps us maintain credibility and trustworthiness in our media practices. Lastly, we must understand the social impact of media, including issues of privacy, diversity, and representation. This understanding allows us to create responsible and inclusive content that positively contributes to society.
