            <p class="info"> In this lesson I learned a lot about the opportunities, challenges and power of media and information because as a student it helps me to apply it for myself.This will also help me because as a student I can use the opportunities of the media as an online seller or that's why it will help my studies also because of the power of the media it makes my school works faster because it helps in My lessons I don't know. And the only challenge here is the abuse of using the media because almost everyone is dependent on the media and it's not good because people can't learn anything.
